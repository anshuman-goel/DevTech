#### Few Notes:

- The ansible-vault file should be named __credys.yml__ and the following credentials should be stored in as key:value pairs (DOTOKEN : 'xxx').
  - AWSAccessKeyId
  - AWSSecretKey
  - git_username
  - git_password
 - AWSAccessKeyId, AWSSecretKey are the accesskeyId and secretKey of an AWS account and git_username, git_password  are the username and password of a Github Ncsu Enterprise account.
- Create an SSH key pair with the name DevOps with your AWS account and store the file in the Milestone1 directory. Make sure that this key file has permissions 0400 or 0600.
- All the variables required for checkbox.io are in the file checkboxvar.yml and they can be modified as required.
- The Node.js file aws.js should always be called with ServerName as an argument.
- The commands to run each playbook are placed as comment at the top of of each playbook.
- The ansible-playbook node.yml is used to configure a local vm and then run aws.js to provision a remote server for Jenkins.
- The ansible-playbook JenkinsConfig.yml is used to install and configure Jenkins on a remote server. It uses files CheckBoxBuild.yml and iTrustBuild.yml which are parsed by the ```jenkins-job-builder``` to automate the creation of jobs for Jenkins.
- Checkbox.yml and iTrust.yml are the ansible-playbooks which are executed in the post-build actions of respective Jenkins jobs to provision and configure a VM for each application.
- The ansible-playbook is an outer level playbook which executes node.yml and JenkinsConfig.yml playbook and thus automating the entire Milestone 1 to a single step.

 ## Experience:

 - Since, most of us haven't worked with Jenkins earlier, 
 figuring out what exactly Jenkins is and how to use it for automation of pipeline , setting it up and dealing with the authentication for Jenkins user took a little more time than expected. 

 - Lack of prior experience with ```jenkins-job-builder``` was the reason why we initially felt that automating Jenkins jobs and builds was a very complex and time-consuming task. Having successfully completed the milestone, we realize how automation of a deployment pipeline using Jenkins is incredibly useful, especially for applications in deployment.
 
 - To figure out exactly how ```jenkins-job-builder``` worked, we initially had to do some reverse engineering by building a job through UI and build using a yml file for ```jenkins-job-builder``` and then compare the config.xml generated in both situations.

 - While trying out different ways to run the build, we encountered a [Jenkins bug](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-43346) which is still open and the documentation was not clear enough for us to figure out how exactly to use jenkins-cli commands using username and password. After some research, we've found a workaround for it using ```build-token-root```.
 
 - While trying to deploy checkbox.io , we've encountered some trouble while trying to set up a mongodb user and accessing the checkbox application. After going through the configuration files and actual code of the appication, we've ended up using mongodb_user ansible module and setting [MONGO_PORT] according to the code in server.js and replacing one of the lines in the config files.

 - Configuring and provisioning iTrust wasn't easy as well since we spent a lot of time setting up Tomcat and copying many configuration files but then realized setting up Tomcat wasn't absolutely necessary.
