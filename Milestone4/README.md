## Report

### Few Notes:

- The ansible-vault file should be named __creds.yml__ and the following credentials should be stored in as key:value pairs (DOTOKEN : 'xxx').
  - AWSAccessKeyId
  - AWSSecretKey
  - git_username
  - git_password
  - vault_password
 - AWSAccessKeyId, AWSSecretKey are the accesskeyId and secretKey of an AWS account and git_username, git_password  are the username and password of a Github Ncsu Enterprise account while vault_password is the password of the ansible vault.
- Create an SSH key pair with the name DevOps with your AWS account and store the file in the [Milestone4](../Milestone4) directory. Make sure that this key file has read-write permissions 0400 or 0600.
- All the variables required for [checkbox.io](https://github.com/anshuman-goel/checkbox.io) are in the file [checkboxvar.yml](../Milestone4/checkboxvar.yml) and they can be modified as required.
- The Node.js file [aws.js](../Milestone4/aws.js) should always be called with ServerName as an argument while the number of servers is optional.
- The commands to run each playbook are placed as comment at the top of of each playbook.
- The ansible-playbook [node.yml](../Milestone4/node.yml) is used to configure a local vm and then run aws.js to provision a remote server for Jenkins.
- The ansible-playbook [JenkinsConfig.yml](../Milestone4/JenkinsConfig.yml) is used to install all the dependencies, setup Jenkins  setup jenkins jobs for Checkbox and iTrust and start the build on a remote server.
- [DockerfileCheckBox](../Milestone4/DockerfileCheckBox) , [DockerfileCheckBoxCanary](../Milestone4/DockerfileCheckBoxCanary), [DockerfileRedisMaster](../Milestone4/DockerfileRedisMaster) and [DockerfileMongoDB](../Milestone4/DockerfileMongoDB) are files used in configuring the kubernetes cluster and implementing a canary release for checkbox.io application.
- [Kubernetes.yml](../Milestone4/kubernetes.yml) is an ansible playbook that sets up and configures the kubernetes cluster for Checkbox. It is also used to Kubernetes Dashboard.
- The ansible-playbook [milestone.yml](../Milestone4/milestone.yml) is an outer level playbook which executes node.yml and JenkinsConfig.yml playbook and thus automating the entire Milestone 4 to a single step.
- The node script [aws_terminate.js](../Milestone4/aws_terminate.js) is the chaos monkey script to randomly delete a master node of Kubernetes cluster.
- The node script [aws_lb_terminate.js](../Milestone4/aws_terminate.js) is the chaos monkey script to delete the load balancer which enables the access to checkbox application.

### High Availability

The implemention for Checkbox in Milestone 3 was in one availability zone. In this Milestone, Kubernetes instances are deployed and maintained on different availability zones. Also to attain high availability, more than one master nodes are maintained.

### Chaos Experiment

Two chaos experiments have been performed in this milestone. First, a chaos monkey is written in Nodejs which radomly deletes a master node. Due to high availability, we find out that application is still up and running. Second, another chos monkey is build to delete the load balancer. In this monkey, the application fails and load balancer needs to created again.

### Nodes Monitoring

Since, the Kubernetes cluster is deployed on various nodes and the health of nodes need to monitored. To monitor the health of the nodes Kubernetes Dashboard has been deployed to monitor CPU and memory usage in real time.
